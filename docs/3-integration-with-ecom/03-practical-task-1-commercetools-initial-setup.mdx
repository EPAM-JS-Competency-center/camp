### What should be done

1. Once you've created an account, you'll have the option to initiate a project. During the project setup, select "**Start with sample data**".

<img src={commercetoolsInitUrl} alt="Description of image" style={{
  width: 600,
  margin: '0 auto',
  display: 'block'
}} />

2. Generate an API client to obtain the `client_id` and `client_secret` required for the authentication process.

<img src={devSettingsUrl} alt="Description of image" style={{
  width: 800,
  margin: '0 auto',
  display: 'block'
}} />


3. **[Obtain an access token](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/authorization)** from Commercetools. Get access token from Commercetools.
4. Download and set up the **[Postman collection](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/postman)** by following the **[Instructions](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-postman-collection/blob/master/GettingStarted.md)** provided by Commercetools.
5. Activate Search in the **Settings > Storefront Search** to use endpoint "`product-projections/search?filter=categories.id:{id}`"

### Acceptance criteria
