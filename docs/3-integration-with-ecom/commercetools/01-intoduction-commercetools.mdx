# 3.3.1 Commercetools introduction

**[Commercetools](https://commercetools.com/)** company vision is to provide the products that growing and innovative companies need to build outstanding and scalable commerce experiences. They give customers a portfolio of commerce technologies at a fraction of the costs compared to building that in-house.
Commercetools was made with a strong focus on MACH principles, especially the "API-First" idea. This means all its features are built to be easily accessible through APIs. Plus, because it's a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, it was created to work seamlessly with cloud technology right from the start.

Understanding Commercetools starts with grasping its foundation on MACH principles, emphasizing flexibility, speed, and a broad toolkit for developers. With a plethora of resources like GitHub repositories for SDKs, Postman Collections for API testing, comprehensive documentation, a Merchant Center for project management, and an Integration Marketplace, Commercetools sets the stage for robust, scalable e-commerce platforms. The platform's approach to product modeling, crucial for e-commerce success, showcases its emphasis on a detailed, customizable setup to cater to specific business needs.
