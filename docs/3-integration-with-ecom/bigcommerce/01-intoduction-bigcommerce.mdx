# 3.4.1 BigCommerce Introduction

**[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/)** aims to provide innovative and scalable commerce solutions for growing businesses. With BigCommerce, companies can access a comprehensive suite of e-commerce technologies at a fraction of the cost of building them in-house. BigCommerce is designed with a strong focus on modern e-commerce principles, particularly the "API-First" approach. This means all its features are accessible through APIs, ensuring seamless integration with various platforms and technologies. As a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, BigCommerce is optimized for cloud environments, offering flexibility and reliability.

Understanding BigCommerce involves recognizing its commitment to flexibility, speed, and an extensive toolkit for developers. The platform provides numerous resources, including GitHub repositories for SDKs, Postman Collections for API testing, comprehensive documentation, a Merchant Center for project management, and an Integration Marketplace. BigCommerce sets the stage for creating robust, scalable e-commerce platforms with a detailed, customizable setup to meet specific business needs.
