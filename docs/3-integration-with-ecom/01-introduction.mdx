# 3.1. Introduction

## What's this module about?

This module is designed to improve knowledge of modern technologies MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless), focusing on commerce provider, a leading platform in the industry.
This offers a hands-on approach to integrating commerce provider with applications, enriching understanding and capabilities in crafting scalable and flexible e-commerce solutions.

By the end of this module, you will have acquired the skills and knowledge necessary to utilize commerce solution provider to build e-commerce solutions. This includes a thorough understanding of product modeling, API integration, and the implementation of scalable architectures in modern e-commerce platforms.

## What you will do?
Undertake practical tasks to set up and integrate commerce provider with an existing application.

- **Initial setup with commerce provider**
  This includes creating an account, initializing a project with sample data for a hands-on experience, and generating an API client. Generate an API client for the authentication process

- **Migration and implementation**
  Migration of products from Magento to commerce provider (**[Commercetools](https://commercetools.com/)** or **[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/)**). Services implementation that connect with commerce provider and integrate with UI.

### How to model?

1. The first option suggests using one `Generic Product Type` for all variants and both `Siz`e and `Color` as attributes.
2. The second option recommends having a `Product Type` for each `Color`, and `Size` as an attribute.
3. The third option advises having a `Product Type` for each `Size`, and `Color` as an attribute.
4. The fourth option proposes having separate product types for each combination of color and size.

When defining the product data model, you should consider factors like the number of products, variants per product, update actions per product, how products will be displayed on the PLP, potential response size, bundling of products, publishing workflow, maintainability as the catalog grow, and the integration of data from the PIM system. This step is crucial and will impact nearly every aspect of the e-commerce business.

### Basics of product modelling

There are a few basic definitions that will explain the basics of product modelling in e-commerce in general.

`Product Type`: Think of this as a class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It contains the essential properties your product. In the image below, for instance, the Product Type is identified as `Clothing`, which contains two additional attributes: `Color` and `Size`.

Depending on the Product Type, you can create specific items such as T-Shirts or Pants. However, selling just a T-Shirt without specifying both its Color and Size is not possible. To address this, Sellable Variants are used, which have defined attributes like a Blue T-Shirt in size M.

In e-commerce, the concept of master and variant products is crucial for managing products.

Product Variants are essentially different versions of a product that share some common attributes. In our example we are selling a t-shirt, the variants include different sizes (small, medium, large) and colors (red, blue, purple). Each variant has its own unique **`SKU`**, which is necessary for inventory management, for instance.

Product end-point holds all the common information about the product. It typically contains details like the product name, description, images, and any attributes that are common across all variants (like brand name, material, etc.).

In Commercetools product must contain at least one Product Variant.

- **`SKU`** stands for Stock Keeping Unit. It is a unique code or identifier assigned to each product in a retailer's inventory. This code is used to track and manage the product in the supply chain.
