# 1.4. Practical Task - Exploring Major Pages and Content in E-commerce Websites

This task allows you to explore key pages and content that form the base of any e-commerce website. By navigating through a local Magento environment, you'll gain practical insights into how these pages are designed and how they function.

- Navigate to https://magento.test/ and explore the Home page (banners, promotions, featured products, best-sellers products, video). 
- Next, navigate to the Product Listing Pages (PLP): https://magento.test/women.html to understand how products are displayed and organized for an optimal shopping experience.
- Continue your exploration from PLP to the Product Details Page (PDP) by clicking on any product, to see how product information is presented in detail.
- Then, try to search products and explore Search Result Page (SRP), which showcases how products are displayed based on search queries.
- Additionally, explore cart management by:
  - Add product(s) to your cart
  - Navigate to the Cart Page, and modify product quantities.
- Finally, experience the checkout process by starting the checkout from the Cart Page. Fill in the mandatory checkout fields and place an order to see the purchasing process.

By mapping each step above with the concepts presented in the deck, you could develop an understanding of the base components and processes that are represented on e-commerce websites.

```example
    resource "test" "test" {
        name     = ""
        location = ""
    }
```
